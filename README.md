**Disclaimer:** JedCore is not a part of ProjectKorra. JedCore is an addon built for use with ProjectKorra. If you manage to break your server with JedCore I cannot be held responsible. JedCore does contain a blacklist so I may prevent users who I don't feel are worthy of having access to my hard work from using it. Anyone who finds them selves blacklisted can message me and appeal to be removed.
